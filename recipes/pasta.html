    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large saucepan with water, put the lid on and bring to the boil over a high heat.</li>
        <li>Add a good pinch of sea salt.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, stir in the pasta.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions. To tell if your pasta is cooked, try a piece about a minute or so before the end of the cooking time. It’s ready when it’s soft enough to eat, but still has a bit of bite. The Italians say ‘al dente’.</li>
        <li>Scoop out a mugful of the starchy cooking water and set aside. This will help emulsify the pasta sauce.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta in a colander over the sink. Now it’s ready to toss through your favourite sauce – it’s best to do this in the pan, adding splashes of cooking water and mixing as you go until your sauce coats the pasta and is the perfect consistency.</li>
    </ol>
